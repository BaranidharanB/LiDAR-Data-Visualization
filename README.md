# LiDAR-Data-Visualization Towards Robust Monocular Depth Estimation

# MiDas Model type
- https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS#model_type
- Select the preferred model required. 

- MiDaS was trained on up to 12 datasets (ReDWeb, DIML, Movies, MegaDepth, WSVD, TartanAir, HRWSI, ApolloScape, BlendedMVS, IRS, KITTI, NYU Depth V2) with multi-objective optimization. The original model that was trained on 5 datasets (MIX 5 in the paper) can be found here. The figure below shows an overview of the different MiDaS models; the bubble size scales with number of parameters.
